title: Hire John to work on your Ember.js project
permalink: /hire-me/
---

I am currently available for select short and long term Ember projects, and have long (15 years) specific industry expertise in Ruby on Rails and more recently Node.js. Previous clients include: LayerVault, Normal Ears, 12stars Media and Express Checkout. 

If you have a project that you think I can add value to, don't hesitate to email me at <a href='mailto:john@mcdowall.inf'>john@mcdowall.info</a> - but before you send that email, know that I get a *lot* of email, so here's some ground rules that will help streamline things for both of us: 

1. No email ping-pong - please be as detailed and specific as possible in your first email. Introduce yourself, your company/project, and why I might want to work with you, and what the work involved would be. 
2. Be clear about what you are looking for: if it's a small project then give an indication of how many days work you think it might be. If it's less than 5 days of work, I won't be able to help you.
3. Be clear about time lines: when are you looking to start, and how long you could wait to start if I'm currently booked. 
4. I don't do hourly work. You can try any of the online hourly worker sites if that's what you need. 

Basically, _send good emails_. Thanks!
