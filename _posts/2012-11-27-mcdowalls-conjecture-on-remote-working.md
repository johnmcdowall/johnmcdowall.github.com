I've heard these excuses time and time again against remote working or working from home:


* _"Remote teams don't work."_
* _"Working from home leads to decreases in quality."_
* _"I think that collaboration is easier when done face to face."_
* _"I don't know what people are doing if they aren't here."_
* _"People just goof off if they work from home."_


David Heinemier Hanson, parter at 37Signals, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3336-cities-with-signals" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Just posted an article</a> on the number of different places that people have worked from in their time with the company. Github are also known to have an _extremely_ geo-distributed team. There are others who manage very well with distributed teams, working remotely. I think it's no coincidence that the common thread amongst these successful geo-distributed companies are that their leaders believe it can work.

I've said many times that _culture is not imposed, it is made up of all of the individuals of a company; their beliefs and standards_. So it is through long observation that I have come to the following rule of thumb:

> If remote working doesn't work at your company, it's your fault.

The corollary to this rule of thumb is:

> The management and leadership elements in a company will reflect their own personal biases and previous failures at remote working onto the notion of remote working; they may also fear the power of a truly self-organizing, self-directed team on their own relevance, and will construct the necessary social cues or fear based mechanisms within the company to ensure its failure or otherwise.
