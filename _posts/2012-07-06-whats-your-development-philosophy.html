<p>Usually I try to get teams to define what '<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/done_done.html" target="_blank">Done Done</a>' is, but <a href="http://cczona.com/blog/2012/05/keeping-it-simple/">this take</a> kind of spins it on its head in a Brian Eno <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies" target="_blank">Oblique Strategy</a> sort of way that I really like:</p><ol><li>Untested code isn’t done.</li><li>Unreleased code isn’t done.</li><li>Undocumented code isn’t done.</li><li>Set many, small, specific goals.</li><li>Simplicity gives you more options than complexity.</li><li>Do something every day. Finish something every week.</li><li>One feature finished is better than ten features planned.</li></ol><p></p><p>Nice and succinct. <em>What's yours?</em></p>
