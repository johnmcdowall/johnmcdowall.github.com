<div class="quote"><blockquote><span>&#147;</span>Taking platform developers and throwing them against hard goals and deadlines kills your ability to adapt. Management <br/>and project stakeholders end up making too many decisions about the technology away from the people who know it <br/>best – the people building it. To show progress and keep management happy, engineers shift their focus to tangible <br/>deliverables and ignore the pieces management can’t understand, like the underlying architecture. You start going <br/>down the path of building lots of bells and whistles, but nothing solid that you can competitively leverage.<span>&#148;</span></blockquote></div>
