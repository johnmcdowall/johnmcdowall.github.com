I've heard these excuses time and time again against remote working or working from home:

- _"Remote teams don't work."_
- <em>"Working from home leads to decreases in quality."</em>
- <em>"I think that collaboration is easier when done face to face." 
- "I don't know what people are doing if they aren't here."
- <em>"People just goof off if they work from home."</em>

David Heinemier Hanson, parter at 37Signals, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3336-cities-with-signals" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Just posted an article</a> on the number of different places that people have worked from in their time with the company. Github are also known to have an _extremely_ geo-distributed team. There are others who manage very well with distributed teams, working remotely. I think it's no coincidence that the common thread amongst these successful geo-distributed companies are that their leaders believe it can work.</p><p>I've said many times that <em>culture is not imposed, it is made up of all of the individuals of a company; their beliefs and standards</em>. So it is through long observation that I have come to the following rule of thumb:</p><blockquote>If remote working doesn't work at your company, it's your fault.</blockquote><p>The corollary to this rule of thumb is:</p><blockquote>The management and leadership elements in a company will reflect their own personal biases and previous failures at remote working&nbsp;onto the notion of remote working;&nbsp;they may also fear the power of a truly self-organizing, self-directed team on their own relevance, and will construct the necessary social cues or fear based mechanisms within the company to ensure its failure or otherwise.
