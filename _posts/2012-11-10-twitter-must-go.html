I think that it eases me into the day by getting my brain going, quickly checking for news headlines, or interesting Tweets with links.&nbsp;</p><p>The trouble is that it actually rarely leads to finding anything satisfying, and often sucks me in to 15 to 20 minutes of aimless browsing sometimes. </p><p>Recently, I've began to question the usefulness of Twitter in my life and why I feel so attached to a medium that is broken. I gave up paying attention to the distorting mainstream media several years ago, but it could be time for a swing back to something of a certain level of quality.</p><p>I'm going to replace Twitter in the morning with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp5558.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, and I'm going to limit Twitter use to one session per day. </p><p>Eventually, I'm just going to stop using it for consumption. </p><p>Everyone has to make their own decision, obviously, but Twitter has reached its peak of maximum onanism for me.</p>
