<p>Don't drink coffee in the street. If you need a coffee, or whatever it is that you drink, go sit somewhere and drink it, or better still sit outside and drink it at a table. Otherwise, drinking coffee while on the move requires the constant use of one hand to hold the coffee cup.<br></p><p>In that time that you are holding that coffee cup, you're going to miss any number of great shots because the time it takes for you to deal with the coffee cup, pick up your camera from your side, frame the shot and finally take the shot means that the decisive moment will be gone. </p><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4716/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4725/508c06e8e4b08e76ed280c57/1351354146929/Arrested.jpg" /><p>Sometimes, I forget. I buy a cup of coffee and walk down the street. That's always when the magic happens.&nbsp;</p>
