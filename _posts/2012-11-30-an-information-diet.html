<p>For the last three weeks I have been following a particular Information Diet program. Specifically:</p><ul><li>Deleted Foursquare from my iPhone. It's a <em>useless</em> habit that actually encourages anti-social, neurotic behaviours.&nbsp;</li><li>Mail.app is only allowed to run for two or three hours a day as and when needed or appropriate. <em>It is not running in the background.</em></li><li>Twitter is only allowed for burst of 5-10minutes only at the beginning, middle or end of the day. </li><li>Un-followed over half of the people I was following on Twitter using this initial guide:<em> From only the persons avatar and description, do I know who they are and why I am following them?</em></li><li>Summary un-following of anyone on Twitter who acts as a repeated for the HackerNews echo chamber, or repeaters of those who do.</li><li>I'm using my New York Times subscription as my news source, not Twitter. </li></ul><p>In the three weeks that I've been following this approach, I've found that my concentration and attention span has improved and I feel less anxious. So far, so QED. </p><p>One of the other benefits is that I feel less <em>angry. </em>The effect of having a channel of&nbsp;external&nbsp;anger, outrage or damaged ego du-jour being&nbsp;unfurled&nbsp;before you every time you log on (Twitter &lt;_&lt;) on you own emotional makeup cannot be underestimated. Use Twitter less, and you'll stop taking on other people's emotional emissions.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm going to continue to add to this regimen and tweak it as I face 2013 determined to <em>create more</em> and consume&nbsp;<em>less.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
