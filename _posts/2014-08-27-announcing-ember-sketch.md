My last post on [How to increase your chances of getting help on #emberjs][1] where I talked about using JSBin to figure things out, I&#8217;ve spent some time over the weekend building a little tool.

<!--more-->

It&#8217;s called Ember Sketch, and you can find it [here][2] or simply install it from the command line with `gem install embersketch`.

## What does it do? I&#8217;m glad you asked <img src="http://ember.zone/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

It&#8217;s a minimalist project generator that allows you to explore little thumbnail-sketches of ideas in Ember. It has all the benefits of JSBin, but with the advantage of being local to your machine, and allowing you true revision control.

All you have to do is say:

`embersketch new <project_name>`

And Ember Sketch will create a little Middleman project to host your experiment.

## Screencast

Here&#8217;s a 5m tutorial on getting started with Embersketch:

Some of you may be thinking that this should/could have been an ember-cli generator, and you&#8217;re right it probably could have â€“ but this was a pure coding joy exercise for me at the weekend, and I didn&#8217;t want to get drawn into Open Source Project Party Time <img src="http://ember.zone/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

Anyway, let me know if you find it useful, or if you want to yell at me for how terrible it is &#8211; either way I love to hear from you!$link-color-hover
