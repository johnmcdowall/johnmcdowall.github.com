  <p>I recently watched Startup.com, and here's some notes I jotted down while watching it.</p><ul><li><p>We should all trust that any one of us will represent a vision of the business that will be seconded and thirded by anyone in the team.</p></li><li><p>We should never be in a confrontation / debate stage in front of anybody.</p></li><li><p>There's a sadness about watching ideas grow until they're beyond the point where you can do anything for them.</p></li><li><p>As soon as someone says "There's no need for this to be ugly" it's going to get ugly.</p></li><li><p>Meet your competitors, befriend them. Force them into making plays earlier than they want to. But only if your product tangibly is better.</p></li><li><p>Don't make your company about your personality as a CEO who 'doesn't lose'.</p></li><li><p>It doesn't matter if the market is big, it's a question of who can make money in it.</p></li><li><p>Always have a third party who can arbitrate.</p></li><li><p>Have a 'Days to Live' countdown board with focussed tasks to achieve in that time</p></li><li><p>Everyone should use the product, CEO down to the person who answers the phones.</p></li><li><p>Be critical on the status of your product's functionality. If it doesn't work, say it doesn't work.</p></li><li><p>Keep momentum on Testing.</p></li><li><p>Security of your product, your office, everything is paramount.</p></li><li><p>Be concerned about revenue. Don't be concerned about the Board. It's their prerogative to fire you or re*shuffle as they see fit, and they will do so.</p></li><li><p>Goals need to be specific and actionable.</p></li><li><p>Any company with two CEOs is in trouble.</p></li><li><p>Even in 2001, mobile phones had some horrific extendable antennas.</p></li><li><p>Sales cycles are always longer than anticipated.</p></li><li><p>Things change. That's the best part.</p></li><li><p>Decline happens quickly and noticeably.</p></li><li><p>The scariest part of this movie is Kaleil Tuzman driving along a wet highway, chanting to a CD and reading from a book held against the wheel.</p></li></ul>
