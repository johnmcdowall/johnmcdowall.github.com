  <p>As the Internet recovers from the summary execution of Google Reader, many people are searching or moving to alternative feed reader services, including me.</p>

<p>It turned out that I had bought a license for <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a>, which is a self-hosted PHP application written by Uber Hipster, <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/pendium/">Sean Inman</a>. All you need is a server to run it on. Enter <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, stage left.</p>

<p>With DigitalOcean, you can rent a VPS for as little as $5 a month: the perfect candidate for running a feed reader service. So I logged in to my account, created an instance for $5 per month, and installed Fever.</p>

<p><em>Total Annual Cost: $60</em> (excluding one off $30 Fever license which I had bought years ago).</p>

<p>Google could potentially be making $60-$120 (I would pay up to $10 a month for such a service) a year from me by basically asking me for money for a service I already used. How much might that be in terms of revenue across the Google Reader user base?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a Quora question about <a href="http://qr.ae/TOrYh">How many users did Google Reader have?</a>, and the guestimate is &lsquo;10s of millions of active users per month.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Some wildly speculative, back of the napkin, math could say that Google just shot in the head a market worth millions of dollars per year.</p>

<p>I know of many startups who would kill to be in that position, so why did Google not simply ask users of Google Reader to pay up?</p>

<p><em>Because it&rsquo;s small business, for them.</em></p>

<p>For a company that makes <em>$50 Billion</em> in annual <em>profit</em>, a product that generates hundreds of millions per year won&rsquo;t make the cut. The engineering talent associated with the project could be better deployed elsewhere to tweak the levers that have a significant impact on that profit total. So, they kill it. It makes good business sense. Google Reader was always destined to be lead to the Abattoir.</p>

<p>Google doesn&rsquo;t do small business.</p>
