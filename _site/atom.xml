   <title>An Information Diet</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/an-information-diet"/>
   <updated>2012-11-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/an-information-diet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last three weeks I have been following a particular Information Diet program. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deleted Foursquare from my iPhone. It's a &lt;em&gt;useless&lt;/em&gt; habit that actually encourages anti-social, neurotic behaviours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mail.app is only allowed to run for two or three hours a day as and when needed or appropriate. &lt;em&gt;It is not running in the background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twitter is only allowed for burst of 5-10minutes only at the beginning, middle or end of the day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Un-followed over half of the people I was following on Twitter using this initial guide:&lt;em&gt; From only the persons avatar and description, do I know who they are and why I am following them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary un-following of anyone on Twitter who acts as a repeated for the HackerNews echo chamber, or repeaters of those who do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm using my New York Times subscription as my news source, not Twitter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three weeks that I've been following this approach, I've found that my concentration and attention span has improved and I feel less anxious. So far, so QED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the other benefits is that I feel less &lt;em&gt;angry. &lt;/em&gt;The effect of having a channel of&amp;nbsp;external&amp;nbsp;anger, outrage or damaged ego du-jour being&amp;nbsp;unfurled&amp;nbsp;before you every time you log on (Twitter &amp;lt;_&amp;lt;) on you own emotional makeup cannot be underestimated. Use Twitter less, and you'll stop taking on other people's emotional emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to continue to add to this regimen and tweak it as I face 2013 determined to &lt;em&gt;create more&lt;/em&gt; and consume&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;less.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>McDowall's Conjecture on Remote Working</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/mcdowalls-conjecture-on-remote-working"/>
   <updated>2012-11-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/mcdowalls-conjecture-on-remote-working</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard these excuses time and time again against remote working or working from home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remote teams don&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Working from home leads to decreases in quality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think that collaboration is easier when done face to face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what people are doing if they aren&amp;rsquo;t here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;People just goof off if they work from home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;David Heinemier Hanson, parter at 37Signals, &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3336-cities-with-signals&quot; data-link-type=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Just posted an article&lt;/a&gt; on the number of different places that people have worked from in their time with the company. Github are also known to have an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; geo-distributed team. There are others who manage very well with distributed teams, working remotely. I think it&amp;rsquo;s no coincidence that the common thread amongst these successful geo-distributed companies are that their leaders believe it can work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times that &lt;em&gt;culture is not imposed, it is made up of all of the individuals of a company; their beliefs and standards&lt;/em&gt;. So it is through long observation that I have come to the following rule of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;If remote working doesn't work at your company, it's your fault.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corollary to this rule of thumb is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The management and leadership elements in a company will reflect their own 
personal biases and previous failures at remote working onto the notion of 
remote working; they may also fear the power of a truly self-organizing, 
self-directed team on their own relevance, and will construct the necessary 
social cues or fear based mechanisms within the company to ensure its 
failure or otherwise.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Twitter Must Go</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.squarespace.com/static/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4716/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4725/509d9d1ae4b081ffff72175a/1352506650842/#img.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, it has become part of my morning ritual that upon waking I immediately check Twitter on my iPhone 4. I think that it eases me into the day by getting my brain going, quickly checking for news headlines, or interesting Tweets with links.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that it actually rarely leads to finding anything satisfying, and often sucks me in to 15 to 20 minutes of aimless browsing sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've began to question the usefulness of Twitter in my life and why I feel so attached to a medium that is broken. I gave up paying attention to the distorting mainstream media several years ago, but it could be time for a swing back to something of a certain level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to replace Twitter in the morning with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp5558.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm going to limit Twitter use to one session per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I'm just going to stop using it for consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to make their own decision, obviously, but Twitter has reached its peak of maximum onanism for me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vagrant: Run commands from Rake as the vagrant user</title>

I did what all good citizens of the open source community should do, which was to fork the Vagrant documentation repo, update the documentation, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/pull/1214&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submit a pull request&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'Boy Scout' principal prevails - try to leave the campsite tidier than when you found it. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't drink coffee in the street. If you need a coffee, or whatever it is that you drink, go sit somewhere and drink it, or better still sit outside and drink it at a table. Otherwise, drinking coffee while on the move requires the constant use of one hand to hold the coffee cup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that time that you are holding that coffee cup, you're going to miss any number of great shots because the time it takes for you to deal with the coffee cup, pick up your camera from your side, frame the shot and finally take the shot means that the decisive moment will be gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.squarespace.com/static/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4716/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4725/508c06e8e4b08e76ed280c57/1351354146929/Arrested.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I forget. I buy a cup of coffee and walk down the street. That's always when the magic happens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Apple Television is already here</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/the-apple-television-is-already-here"/>
   <updated>2012-10-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/the-apple-television-is-already-here</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Edgar Allen Poe wrote a fairly entertaining story back in December 1844 called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purloined_Letter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;In the story, a stolen letter is sought after by the Police and they search a room belonging to the suspect for the letter, looking behind every picture frame, underneath every object. The thief, knowing that the Police would be searching for something hidden, left the letter in plain sight&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;he knew they would be blind to it in their search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at Apple's recent product update event, we saw two things of particular interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is that they brought forward the typical iPad refresh forward from the Spring when it has historically happened, into the Fall. On the historical Apple event calendar this now creates a gap in the release cycle next year, as according to previous events, the next typical Apple product update is OSX in the summer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second item of interest is that the iMac received a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ca/imac/features/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very dramatic update&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.squarespace.com/static/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4716/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4725/508a9790e4b08eaef9f325ab/1351260050133/processors_hero.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The iMac has been made ultra-thin; apparently by as much as 80% thinner. It's a beautiful piece of engineering and design; something worthy of hanging on a wall perhaps? While that is a dramatic engineering feat of its own right, the secondary thing of interest to note is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MC914LL/B/apple-thunderbolt-display-27-inch?fnode=53&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thunderbolt display&lt;/a&gt; which would seem to share much of the component and chassis characteristics of the iMac&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;did not receive an update.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbolt display, essentially a fancy monitor, could be redundant in a post Apple Television world. It happens to already be the most TV-like device Apple makes. Choosing not to update it, then, would make sense - if you intended to do something dramatic in the Spring, something dramatic that you just happened to have created room for by bringing the iPad refresh forward in the update cycle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the new iMac chassis could well be a pre-cursor to the design and shape of an Apple Television, which will be released in the Spring of 2013. I believe it contains, at the very least, the DNA of this new Apple endeavour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if Apple have hidden their next direction in plain sight. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Best Hardware is not a Job Perk</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/the-best-hardware-is-not-a-job-perk"/>
   <updated>2012-09-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/the-best-hardware-is-not-a-job-perk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's very common for startups to advertise that they provide you with the 'best' hardware, usually Apple, as a perk of the job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could very likely be a warning sign, in my experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that someone would sell you a job opportunity, with the notion that they are not going to give you a stone age behemoth, a 640x480 resolution screen, reclaimed high school chairs and a desk made from breeze blocks and planks, and that anything above that is a 'perk' is insanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also likely means that your hire is viewed as a cog that needs to be fitted into the machine, and the necessary equipment you need is seen as a condition that grudgingly must be supplied in order to attract talent. They view the tools that you use as simply a ploy to get you inside, and don't value the difference they make to your working life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am telling you that this is your &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. You are expected to work 8-12hr or longer days, remain seated or stationary staring at a device that causes your eyes to dry out and any myriad of other health problems; the 'best' is the absolute minimum required. A fast, efficient machine to work on is not a joyful toy given to pacify - it is a means to professional excellence. It is a means to creative flow. It is a means to doing the best work of your life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about the 'best'. Usually its assumed that you will want everything Apple, and maybe this is the case.&amp;nbsp;Maybe you don't want two screens, because one large one works for you. Maybe you just really like Dell machines.&amp;nbsp;But a good employer will understand that Humans taken different things to help them achieve good and sustainable work, so closing that dialog off early could also be a warning sign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on the specifications for the 'best', it should stand to reason that the equipment should be the top of the line possible. If the machine you want can take 16Gb of RAM, then it should be ordered with 16Gb of RAM in it. An 512Gb SSD should be the default. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employers will take a wait and see approach to developers complaining that they need more resources, and this is very sad. They are shortchanging themselves, and they are devaluing you and the work that you do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes this is expensive. But if the company you want to work for values you as a Human, and that you spend a far greater amount of time on the tools you need to do your work than you should, and if they understand that the better the hardware you have to work on can make you more efficient and &lt;i&gt;happier &amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;and more able to do great work, then they are likely to view it as a cost that simply has to be met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's a company you want to work for. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Henry Miller Was a Better Programmer Than You Are</title>

   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/henry-miller-was-a-better-programmer-than-you-are</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Miller&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Henry Miller&lt;/a&gt; was an American writer and painter, famous for pushing the boundaries of literature and creating several seminal and controversial works. In his book '&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Henry-Miller-Writing-Directions-Paperbook/dp/0811201120&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Henry Miller on Writing&lt;/a&gt;' he speaks about his 'Commandments' and 'Daily Program'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henry Miller's 11 Commandments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on one thing at a time until finished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start no more new books, add no more new material to ‘Black Spring.’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you can’t create you can work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henry Miller's Daily Program:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORNINGS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If groggy, type notes and allocate, as stimulus.If in fine fettle, write.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERNOONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work of section in hand, following plan of section scrupulously. No intrusions, no diversions. Write to finish one section at a time, for good and all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVENINGS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;See friends. Read in cafés.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore unfamiliar sections — on foot if wet, on bicycle if dry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write, if in mood, but only on Minor program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paint if empty or tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Notes. Make Charts, Plans. Make corrections of MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: Allow sufficient time during daylight to make an occasional visit to museums or an occasional sketch or an occasional bike ride. Sketch in cafés and trains and streets. Cut the movies! Library for references once a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Great writers and thinkers are often found to have had such 'programs' and commandments that helped give structure to the work that they did. Given that I am now operating my own software consultancy and product development studio, a regimen like this could be beneficial since the life of a writer and a programmer share certain parallels in the type of structured creativity that must be applied. I think that Miller's ability to do great work is somewhat related to his ability to maintain an ordered structure to his day and to his work. He shipped. Relentlessly. And this probably makes him a better programmer than you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Here's my first interpretation of Miller's commandments and program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My 11 Commandments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on one thing at a time until finished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with no more new frameworks or libraries until the current work is done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with a good test suite, and keep a clear and consistent dialog with your clients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you can’t create you can work. Fix bugs or perform code gardening and weeding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers. Invest time in your tools and get better at them -don't supriously add new ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it. Twitter is not a substitiute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forget the programs you want to write. Think only of the program you are writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code first and always. Design, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Daily Program:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORNINGS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;List commitments for the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If groggy, type notes and allocate, as stimulus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If in fine fettle, program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERNOONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on story in hand, following plan of story scrupulously.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As everyone is no doubt aware, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1189-investing-in-github&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub took on $100M&lt;/a&gt; of investment capital from Andreessen-Horowitz recently. The big question on everybody's lips was: 'Why?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen wrote recently about '&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html&quot;&gt;Why Software is Eating The World&lt;/a&gt;'. It's a great article and if you haven't read it I'll wait for you to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Andreessen highlights a number of areas where software has converged to make two previously separate things work together in new ways that allow the makers to gobble up markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we think about GitHub, and a $100M injection of capital, what's the missing piece that could allow GitHub to expand and gobble up a new market place? Who should be afraid of this turn of events?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub is where increasingly more of the world's code &lt;em&gt;lives.&lt;font class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=&quot;#111111&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=&quot;#111111&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;The code is created by developers, distributed through GitHub and deployed onto servers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2, Heroku and Windows Azure are increasingly the end destination for much of that code. You can deploy to Heroku with a simple commit and push via Git. It's a lucrative market, with Salesforce recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/&quot;&gt;snapping up Heroku for $212M in cash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that the next phase of GitHub will be to build its own Platform as a Service&lt;/strong&gt;, that will provide exactly the same benefits and services as Heroku, but at a radical price point. GitHub will use that $100M of capital to build out this service and developers will flock to it, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because their code already lives on GitHub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; They will build an frictionless experience that trumps any existing deploy model, perhaps even so that your code just automatically becomes available on the web after each commit. Closing the deploy loop is the next logical step for GitHub, and a reason why they would need cash in excess of their current profits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub will become&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; de-facto development platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then GitHub will eat the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Working for a Software Company in the 21st Century Should Be Like</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/what-working-for-a-software-company-in-the-21st-century-should-be-like"/>
   <updated>2012-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/what-working-for-a-software-company-in-the-21st-century-should-be-like</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's my manifesto of sorts on what the modern working environment for information workers should be like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on results shipped not time spent. &lt;/strong&gt;It shouldn't matter how little or how much time is 'put in' on a given day because you know and trust that all of your co-workers are investing just as much into the business as you are, and that people have been hired to do the right thing. Let them. And let them do it in the way that is optimal for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location independent. &lt;/strong&gt;There is no need for teams to be co-located today. It's often said that remote teams just don't work, but I think this is a combination of two things: hiring the wrong people, and a failure in shared understanding and purpose. Both of these things are management issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free flowing. &lt;/strong&gt;Work should be able to be started with the minimum amount of process as possible, and should be allowed to proceed until complete.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Focussed. &lt;/strong&gt;The customer is most definitely not always right, especially on the Internet, but everyone in the company needs to understand that we are here to provide value for the customer, not to pad our Resumes or architect systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptable. &lt;/strong&gt;If anyone needs to take time off, this should be achievable with the minimum amount of fuss and red-tape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsible Vacations.&lt;/strong&gt; People should be allowed to plan and take time off whenever it is needed. And when they come back they should be expected to knock it out of the park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting-less. &lt;/strong&gt;A zero meeting environment may be impossible, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Meetings_Are_Toxic.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they are toxic&lt;/a&gt; and should be avoided at all costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metric based. &lt;/strong&gt;What cannot be measured cannot be managed. No one should be judged except on the value of their output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid. &lt;/strong&gt;People should be allowed to move from work area to work area. It'll increase their skills and make better products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/my-notes-from-the-movie-startupcom</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently watched Startup.com, and here's some notes I jotted down while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should all trust that any one of us will represent a vision of the business that will be seconded and thirded by anyone in the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should never be in a confrontation / debate stage in front of anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a sadness about watching ideas grow until they're beyond the point where you can do anything for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as someone says &quot;There's no need for this to be ugly&quot; it's going to get ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet your competitors, befriend them. Force them into making plays earlier than they want to. But only if your product tangibly is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't make your company about your personality as a CEO who 'doesn't lose'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if the market is big, it's a question of who can make money in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always have a third party who can arbitrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a 'Days to Live' countdown board with focussed tasks to achieve in that time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone should use the product, CEO down to the person who answers the phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be critical on the status of your product's functionality. If it doesn't work, say it doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep momentum on Testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security of your product, your office, everything is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be concerned about revenue. Don't be concerned about the Board. It's their prerogative to fire you or re*shuffle as they see fit, and they will do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals need to be specific and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any company with two CEOs is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in 2001, mobile phones had some horrific extendable antennas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales cycles are always longer than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things change. That's the best part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decline happens quickly and noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scariest part of this movie is Kaleil Tuzman driving along a wet highway, chanting to a CD and reading from a book held against the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Old Houses and Software Projects</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/old-houses-and-software-projects"/>
   <updated>2012-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/old-houses-and-software-projects</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Old Houses are products of accretion. Over the course of many years they gather new extensions, tweaked facades, upgraded central or under-floor heating systems, alarm systems, downstairs washrooms and nurseries. And usually, once one project is completed, you'll bask in the glow of it for a while until it's forgotten about and the next one embarked upon. Just like Software projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.squarespace.com/static/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4716/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4725/4ffc637884ae51f071734d0d/1341940598720/old_house.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lived once in a big, old house which had stood for over 80 years. It'd been split up so that a couple lived in the back portion, I lived in the front half, and there was a basement apartment. Sound can travel in funny ways in such old houses, split up like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see there are the remenants of what were once ducts for the purposes of a forced air central heating system, all through the house. The air vents are now partially sealed, but the ornamentation on the baseboard that gives away their purpose is still there. The ducts lie embedded within the walls still. Long forgotten about, these heating ducts were probably installed at great expense at the time, for what was felt to be the ultimate in home comfort: hot air blown into the rooms from a central heater!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, the old air heater was pulled out, radiators were found and installed, and a fancy Swedish boiler system now silently and efficiently pumps hot water around the piping and heats the house. And the ducts remain, in the walls, now sealed up and silent. Except for when they carry sound in funny ways. Old houses are like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I was treated to the sounds of someone somewhere else in the house enjoying vigorous, short lived coitus, the echoes of it carried inside the bones of the house, inside these long forgoten about ducts that serve no purpose. Should the ducts be ripped out? That would be very costly, disruptive to the residents, and damaging to the house. So they stay. Silently embedded within the walls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the infastructure portions of almost every software design that's ever been written. Look at your codebase. Is there something in there, some remnant of infrastructure that was built with the greatest of hopes and expectations, only to be roundly replaced when you understood the problem better? Has it left a legacy that occasionally flares up or acts as the conduit for some other misbehaving component in the project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing that code might be too hard now, because nobody writes perfect software. Some brittle tests somewhere might flare up, or a method call somewhere might explode.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet that code sits there, inside your digital walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Projects can be like building houses. The construction continues long after the thing is 'finished', and you end up living with the choices you make for a long time, usually forever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, in the night, you hear odd noises carried by those old ducts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usually I try to get teams to define what '&lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/done_done.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Done Done&lt;/a&gt;' is, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://cczona.com/blog/2012/05/keeping-it-simple/&quot;&gt;this take&lt;/a&gt; kind of spins it on its head in a Brian Eno &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oblique Strategy&lt;/a&gt; sort of way that I really like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Untested code isn’t done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unreleased code isn’t done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Undocumented code isn’t done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set many, small, specific goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simplicity gives you more options than complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do something every day.

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#147;&lt;/span&gt;Taking platform developers and throwing them against hard goals and deadlines kills your ability to adapt. Management &lt;br/&gt;and project stakeholders end up making too many decisions about the technology away from the people who know it &lt;br/&gt;best – the people building it. To show progress and keep management happy, engineers shift their focus to tangible &lt;br/&gt;deliverables and ignore the pieces management can’t understand, like the underlying architecture. You start going &lt;br/&gt;down the path of building lots of bells and whistles, but nothing solid that you can competitively leverage.&lt;span&gt;&amp;#148;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It cannot fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as the Space Shuttle has been retired, so will Facebook be placed on the funeral boat and shoved out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something better will replace it, just as the Space Shuttle is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/say-hello-to-your-new-space-shuttle-replacement.php&quot; data-bitly-type=&quot;bitly_hover_card&quot;&gt;replaced by smaller, leaner craft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will replace Facebook?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
