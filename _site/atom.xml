   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Corey Haines has already &lt;a href=&quot;(http://blog.coreyhaines.com/2012/12/why-i-dont-use-activesupportconcern.html&quot;&gt;masterfully expounded&lt;/a&gt; on why &lt;code&gt;ActiveSupport::Concern&lt;/code&gt; will lead to you having a Real Bad Time - and you really should read it, but I wanted to write a quick cautionary tale to those thinking about using Concerns and highlight a couple of the more practical pains explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Headless Horseman&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ActiveSupport::Concern&lt;/code&gt; may not have been intended to be used this way, but I see it used this way in a lot of Rails projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on since the introduction of Concerns. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about discorporated methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;active_support/concern&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;MonsterConcern&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;ActiveSupport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:Concern&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;included&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;can_fangs_be_seen_by_children?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nearby_children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;can_see?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:fangs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;shaggy_monster&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;make_coat_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:shaggy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;engage_rage&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;chew_bones&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have four disembodied methods here, stuck in a file. We get no indication of &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; includes this file - if we&amp;rsquo;re lucky the name might reflect that information, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not exact. Where should we go to see where the &lt;code&gt;nearby_children&lt;/code&gt; method is defined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Goose Chase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to look at the &lt;code&gt;make_coat_type&lt;/code&gt; method. Where is it? It could be on the &lt;code&gt;Monster&lt;/code&gt; model, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. If we&amp;rsquo;re lucky, maybe we spy a file called &lt;code&gt;monster_coat_type.rb&lt;/code&gt;, but chances are it&amp;rsquo;s bundled into something bigger. Eventually we find the appropriate method, but it&amp;rsquo;s in another concern file that we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hunt and Peck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New developers might look through a couple of files before they hit the thing they are looking for, because Concerns give no indication of what they contain at the file name level. Better developers will &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; immediately, but even then they might waste time optimistically looking in a couple of file that seem likely first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ActiveSupport::Concern&lt;/code&gt; actually makes your code base worse. They make it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harder to reason about the code you are currently reading. You must satisfy several mental dependencies before you can make any kind of informed change in the code you are looking at. This increased mental barrier also makes it more likely that a developer will make a mistake in the code they are changing inside a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harder to navigate the codebase. If I want to look at the &lt;code&gt;make_coat_type&lt;/code&gt; method, I have to already know that it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t live on the main &lt;code&gt;Monster&lt;/code&gt; model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is actually inside another file which contains a different &lt;code&gt;Concern&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encourage a use of Modules that is just as bad as &amp;lsquo;The Kitchen Drawer&amp;rsquo; approach to using the &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt; directory that we know is bad, but this time it&amp;rsquo;s at a much more fine grained line-of-code level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is all symptomatic of the Rails world only now just coming to terms with some of the Domain Driven Design concepts of Services, and at the same time having the project leader stand behind a really badly thought out approach to handling complex large software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A simple Rake task to update Ember.js</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/a-simple-rake-task-to-update-ember-js"/>
   <updated>2013-04-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/a-simple-rake-task-to-update-ember-js</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was using a Rake task that I had seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IvanVanderbyl&quot;&gt;Ivan Vanderbyl&lt;/a&gt; using to update the Ember source files to whatever was the latest available. It assumed you were using the &lt;code&gt;ember-rails&lt;/code&gt; gem and it would pull down the repos necessary, build the projects, and place the compilation results in the &lt;code&gt;vendor&lt;/code&gt; directory so that the asset pipeline would pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Ember team put some work into getting builds served up from S3, the process of getting the latest code has become super simple. All you need is this Rake task in your &lt;code&gt;lib/tasks&lt;/code&gt; folder and away you go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# A simple rake task to update Ember and Ember Data to latest official build from S3.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Assumptions:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# - You&amp;#39;re using the `ember-rails` gem&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# - You are requiring rember with sprockets with something like `require ember`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Usage:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   $ rake ember:update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#  This will place a development build (with comments and debug tags) into:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   vendor/assets/ember/development/ember.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#  and a production minified build (no comments or debug tags) into:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   vendor/assets/ember/production/ember.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Idea by Ivan Vanderbyl (ivan@crashlog.io) December, 2012&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This implementation by John McDowall (john@mcdowall.info) April, 2013&lt;/span&gt;
 
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block_given?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quietly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; Done.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
 
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:ember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;desc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Update Ember.js from latest Builds on S3.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:update&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:core&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Grabbing Core from S3...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;curl -# http://builds.emberjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/ember-latest.js -o vendor/assets/ember/development/ember.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;curl -# http://builds.emberjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/ember-latest.min.js -o vendor/assets/ember/production/ember.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;say&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Grabbing Data from S3...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;curl -# http://builds.emberjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/ember-data-latest.js -o vendor/assets/ember/development/ember-data.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;curl -# http://builds.emberjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/ember-data-latest.min.js -o vendor/assets/ember/production/ember-data.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you can simply say &lt;code&gt;rake ember:update&lt;/code&gt; and if you&amp;rsquo;re using the &lt;code&gt;ember-rails&lt;/code&gt; gem, you&amp;rsquo;ll get the latest builds in no time at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting started with Internationalization (i18n) in Ember.js</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/getting-started-with-internationalization-i18n-in-ember-js"/>
   <updated>2013-04-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/getting-started-with-internationalization-i18n-in-ember-js</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Writing your Ember.js app to include Internationalization support is easy. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick guide on how to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab the CLDR.js library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesarosen/CLDR.js&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. CLDR provides a bunch of handy pluralization logic that works across different locales. You want it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, grab the ember-i18n library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesarosen/ember-i18n&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is the meat and potatoes of handling i18n in Ember applications, and it takes care of all of the gritty details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, before you create your Ember application, make sure to set the default locale for CLDR like so:
&lt;code&gt;CLDR.defaultLocale = &#39;en&#39;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, create a file called &lt;code&gt;i18n.js&lt;/code&gt; that you will load after &lt;code&gt;CLDR.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ember-i18n&lt;/code&gt;. This is where you will store your i18n strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;i18n.js&lt;/code&gt; file, simply setup an object like so, with the appropriate keys for your application:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;I18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;translations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;user.edit.title&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Edit User&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;user.followers.title.one&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;One Follower&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;user.followers.title.other&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;All  Followers&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;button.add_user.title&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Add a user&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;button.add_user.text&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Add&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;button.add_user.disabled&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Saving...&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In your Handlebars templates, you can now reference the usual &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; object to get the i18n strings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{ { t user.edit.title } }&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that was pretty easy, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ember Application Initializers</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/ember-application-initializers"/>
   <updated>2013-04-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/ember-application-initializers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ember Application Initializers allow you to register blocks of code that execute when your Ember application is initializing. With an Initializer, you could access Ember&amp;rsquo;s underlying object container, grab all the controllers and inject other objects into them, register global DOM &lt;code&gt;onReady&lt;/code&gt; event blocks or anything that is useful to setting up your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the Initializer requires a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute and an &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic Application Initializer looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Ember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;initializerName&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Initializers can also specify dependencies by using a &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt; attribute which references the name of the Initializer it should run after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Ember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;initializerFirst&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Ember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;initializerSecond&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;initializerFirst&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Some example use cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some examples of using Application initializers to clean up repeated code, or give code that would otherwise run outside of Ember a home inside Ember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Looking up objects in the Container &amp;amp; Injecting Types&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look up objects in the Container inside the &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; method like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  var store = container.lookup(&#39;store:main&#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you could inject a controller into all other loaded controllers in the container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  var controller = container.lookup(&#39;controller:currentUser&#39;).set(&#39;content&#39;, user)
  container.typeInjection(&#39;controller&#39;, &#39;currentUser&#39;, &#39;controller:currentUser&#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Defining global DOM &lt;code&gt;onReady&lt;/code&gt; blocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need code to be executed when the DOM is ready and want a clean place to integrate it into your Ember app, you can use an initializer. This example loads a current-user attribute from a &lt;code&gt;META&lt;/code&gt; tag in the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Ember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;initializerName&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Look up an attribute in a meta tag */&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;attributes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;meta[name=&amp;quot;current-user&amp;quot;]&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;content&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* Do something with it */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using Rails, this would be a good way to get the CSRF token and use it in the jQuery AJAX setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Pre-loading records&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make the initial Ember application experience even faster is to render some records as JSON strings into the HTML document body. When your Ember application starts up, you can load those records from the document and create instances from them, thus saving an initial AJAX call to fetch the records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assembled this knowledge from a rag-tag collection of blog posts and gists, namely this Gist by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ivanvanderbyl/4560416&quot;&gt;Ian Vanderbyl&lt;/a&gt; and this blog post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://say26.com/using-rails-devise-with-ember-js&quot;&gt;Alexander Zaytsev on using Ember with Rails and Devise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only scratches the surface of what could be possible with Ember Application Initializers. They are poorly documented at the moment, and could change their behavior at any time before the 1.0 release, but until that happens use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Google doesn't do Small Business</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/google-doesn-t-do-small-business"/>
   <updated>2013-03-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/google-doesn-t-do-small-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the Internet recovers from the summary execution of Google Reader, many people are searching or moving to alternative feed reader services, including me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that I had bought a license for &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedafever.com&quot;&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt;, which is a self-hosted PHP application written by Uber Hipster, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shauninman.com/pendium/&quot;&gt;Sean Inman&lt;/a&gt;. All you need is a server to run it on. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;, stage left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With DigitalOcean, you can rent a VPS for as little as $5 a month: the perfect candidate for running a feed reader service. So I logged in to my account, created an instance for $5 per month, and installed Fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total Annual Cost: $60&lt;/em&gt; (excluding one off $30 Fever license which I had bought years ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google could potentially be making $60-$120 (I would pay up to $10 a month for such a service) a year from me by basically asking me for money for a service I already used. How much might that be in terms of revenue across the Google Reader user base?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a Quora question about &lt;a href=&quot;http://qr.ae/TOrYh&quot;&gt;How many users did Google Reader have?&lt;/a&gt;, and the guestimate is &amp;lsquo;10s of millions of active users per month.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some wildly speculative, back of the napkin, math could say that Google just shot in the head a market worth millions of dollars per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know of many startups who would kill to be in that position, so why did Google not simply ask users of Google Reader to pay up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s small business, for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company that makes &lt;em&gt;$50 Billion&lt;/em&gt; in annual &lt;em&gt;profit&lt;/em&gt;, a product that generates hundreds of millions per year won&amp;rsquo;t make the cut. The engineering talent associated with the project could be better deployed elsewhere to tweak the levers that have a significant impact on that profit total. So, they kill it. It makes good business sense. Google Reader was always destined to be lead to the Abattoir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t do small business.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Search is the homeless guy of your application</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/search-is-the-the-homeless-guy-of-your-app"/>
   <updated>2013-02-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/search-is-the-the-homeless-guy-of-your-app</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most people walk past the homeless. They ignore the out-thrust hands, the pleas for &amp;lsquo;spare change&amp;rsquo;, and avoid the possibility of making eye contact. Search is the homeless guy or gal of your App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve built all of these elaborate features and imagined use cases, but the basic route for a user to discover what data is inside your App, that meets their needs, is ignored and left to languish on the cold street. It&amp;rsquo;s an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At most, you&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a text box that does a basic fuzzy string matching and lands the user on a useless list page of results, hopefully with some paging controls. At best, you&amp;rsquo;ve done the basics and provided some sort of ordering maybe. Your App sucks at search. It sucks in every way that is meaningful to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users should not have to think about what type of object they want to search for in your App (&amp;lsquo;Is it a contact, an address, a postcode?&amp;rsquo;), and choose that thing from a dropdown before the search works correctly. The search results should not be a list of context-less results that require further analysis by the user. Results should not share the same cookie-cutter visual appearance: if some results are more relevant than others, make them visually more relevant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you build an App that has useless search, you&amp;rsquo;re denting and diminishing the value that your App provides to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s said that Security can&amp;rsquo;t be baked into an application at the end, that it&amp;rsquo;s got to be a primary concern. Well, just like Security, neither can a good and useful Search feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So start at the beginning, planning out how users will search the data they&amp;rsquo;ve put into your application, what tasks will they try to solve by searching, and bake it into the cake from the start. Spare your search feature some change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your users will thank you, and find your App to be much more useful - I guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gemfile Best Practices &amp; Discourse</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/gemfile-best-practices-and-discourse"/>
   <updated>2013-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/gemfile-best-practices-and-discourse</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/93&quot;&gt;did some Boy Scouting&lt;/a&gt; on the newly released &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse&quot;&gt;Discourse project&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hans-eric.com/2010/07/26/the-boy-scout-rule/&quot;&gt;Boy Scout Rule&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discourse is a Rails project, which means it has a nice fat, juicy Gemfile listing all of its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gemfile tends to be the first thing I look at in an unfamiliar Rails project in order to get a quick mental overview of what makes up the application and if it&amp;rsquo;s using any custom forks or private libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to form a set of best practices for the general organization of Gemfiles that I think are very useful when on-boarding new developers and keeping order in your Gemfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent use of Ruby hash syntax. Use either the old hashrocket or the new Ruby 1.9 syntax, but not both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent use of a single quoted delimiter. Use either apostrophes or quotation marks, but not both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No commented Gem references. If it&amp;rsquo;s commented out, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments relating to a Gem are on the same line as the gem statement, not above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group gems that are sourced from Git repos at the top. Chances are they are referencing pre-versions that will become general release and you can change the reference to be part of the General project group later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group gems that are sourced from a project path after Git repo sourced Gems. These are probably gems that you might make public and thus reference in the general project gem group later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group all of the General project gems together (consider using the &lt;code&gt;:default&lt;/code&gt; group).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group all of the Production project gems together after the General gems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group all of the Asset gems after the Production group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group all of the Test related gems after the Asset gems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group all of the Development related gems after the Test gems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within all Gem groups, sort the references by Alphabetical order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When adding new gems, maintain the alphabetical ordering within the groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These guidelines produce a Gemfile which is logical and ordered: no little clumps of Gems related to the main project here and there. The alphabetical ordering within the groups increases scanability to see if a Gem has already been included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my Discourse Gemfile changes:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Technical choices should be - above all else - ethical.</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/technical-choices-should-be-above-all-else-ethical"/>
   <updated>2013-01-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/technical-choices-should-be-above-all-else-ethical</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working for yourself, in which case do whatever your little heart desires, but if you&amp;rsquo;re building something for a client then your primary concern should be making ethical technical choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When someone else is paying you to code, your responsibility to them is foremost to create the most value possible for their cash investment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, I see developers making technical choices that go against the following principles, and while they may not deliberately set out to be un-ethical, and can often make elaborate justifications, the net result is ultimately a question of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I unnecessarily constraining my client&amp;rsquo;s future hiring pool by using this technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this technology the most reasonable fit for the problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I know enough about this technology to say that it will be reliable, documented, and well supported?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will this technology allow the project to be delivered within the timelines or is their a risk that it could in fact swell timelines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does my client understand &lt;em&gt;as completely as possible&lt;/em&gt; the implications of the choice I am making?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my client insisting on the use of a technology without understanding &lt;em&gt;as completely as possible&lt;/em&gt; any of the above questions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Or you could turn these questions on their head and make statements. Working for a client is not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An opportunity for you to explore new technologies that your client can&amp;rsquo;t find anyone else to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An opportunity to use a technology for exploring the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to grow your skill set on their time and money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An opportunity to introduce more risk into a project at the expense of the client&amp;rsquo;s timelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An opportunity to blame the client for being &amp;lsquo;stupid&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chance to tread gray areas in order to expand your resume for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Cinematic User Engagement</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/cinematic-user-engagement"/>
   <updated>2013-01-14T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/cinematic-user-engagement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/0w2t2u080P0R0W0p0334/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-13%20at%2010.55.59%20PM.png&quot; title=&quot;Dr Strangelove&quot; alt=&quot;Dr Strangelove&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive User Engagement might be the wrong way to go, when we have all the tools necessary in the browser to present a more cinematic initial experience to a new user, and a chance to increase the perceived value of the product before they begin to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of your favorite movies. Do you remember the title sequence? Maybe. Title sequences often go un-noticed by audiences, usually because they are constructed in a way as to help set the tone without being distracting. Or in the case of Star Wars, go all out to signal the beginning of something never before seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Directors spend great amounts of time choosing the title sequence font and how the dynamics of the sequence plays out. They do this because it can give the viewer a subtle clue as to what kind of movie they are about to see. And if done well, it can greatly enhance the impact of the opening sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/mRtT4HHQef0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Half Life 2 was arguably the first game to raise the bar (ho ho!) in terms of convergence between Game and Movie. It borrowed many of the idioms of the Movie opening sequence throughout the game to mask the necessary loading sections between levels, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/KNCgs_47t28&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In one of the sequels, Half Life 2: Episode One, Valve went to far as to incorporate a new type of &amp;lsquo;Cinematic Physics&amp;rsquo; intended to bring the grand spectacle of the movies to the small screen, and deepen user immersion. As did Crysis 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/8pPI3i12hIw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cinematic Physics seems to involve a lot of bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some authors have written about Progressive User Engagement, where the user is gradually introduced to form elements that request necessary information, or defer the collection of that information until later, in order to have as frictionless a process as possible for the new user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning here is that since the signup process is a one time experience for the user, its best to get it over as quickly and painlessly as possible. The result tends to be small, static form elements that are served up briefly and then moved out of the way, and the user thrown into the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this strategy misses a chance to instead further deepen the experience for the user in such a way that it sets the tone for the forthcoming application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we utilize the &amp;lsquo;Cinematic User Engagement&amp;rsquo; techniques for the web? What if we were to layer the notion of &amp;lsquo;Cinematic User Engagement&amp;rsquo; on to these ideas of Progressive User Engagement? What would this look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think for a first pass, we could borrow some elements from Game Consoles such as the XBox 360 and their ideas around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot_user_interface&quot;&gt;10-foot user interface&lt;/a&gt;, and motion graphic design ironically often used in Movies to present a laughable cinematic notion of futuristic computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of having cluttered screens that carry over brand, footers and other extraneous elements, we could have a completely minimalist screen which only displays the current element the user is to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of having small forms, we could user over-sized text on high contrast backgrounds and fading techniques to transition from one form element to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/1D2L1T0f0B0F2K1y0w16/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-13%20at%2011.23.43%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could utilize HTML5 video elements to provide subtle backgrounds that set the tone for the Application the user is about to enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtle audio or music could be used to provide cues to the user at key stages. The Motion Graphics concept of the New MySpace demonstrates this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/50071857?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/50071857&quot;&gt;The new Myspace&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/myspace&quot;&gt;Myspace&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all of the necessary details have been collected, immediately launch a full-screen HTML5 video showing a user operating the application to get the central task it supports done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is much that could be done in the browser using CSS3 and JavaScript to increase and enhance the user experience during first contact, that we are only beginning to scratch the surfaces of. And while it may not suit every application, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a technique that could create a lasting impression in your user&amp;rsquo;s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of web application user experience lies somewhere in the convergence of movie, game and appliance - that space will be the battleground for user adoption in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to find the time to build a demo of these concepts, or if someone wants to take these ideas and execute them, I&amp;rsquo;ll gladly work with you. Just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john@mcdowall.info&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>This is David Heinemeier Hansson</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/this-is-david-heinemeier-hansson"/>
   <updated>2013-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/this-is-david-heinemeier-hansson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/david.jpg&quot; title=&quot;David Heinemeier Hansson&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson is a hell of a guy. He&amp;rsquo;s responsible for one of the best web development frameworks in the world, Ruby on Rails. He&amp;rsquo;s always been outspoken and a force to be reckoned with, but lately his writings have taken on the tone of an old man ranting at what the kids are into these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s inside his own Isolator, writing from his oak-paneled study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what evidence is there that he&amp;rsquo;s inside his Isolator? What follows is not an attack, but an attempt at a broad analysis of the character of his recent writings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His recent post on what he thinks is &lt;a href=&quot;http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/dependency-injection-is-not-a-virtue.html&quot;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Dependency Injection&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeulate.com/2013/01/a-criticism-of-dhhs-post-on-dependency-injection/&quot;&gt;rightly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismdp.com/2013/01/dependency-injection-not-ioc/&quot;&gt;prosecuted&lt;/a&gt; as an ill informed and at worse deliberately disingenuous piece of self oriented propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nat Pryce, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmock.org/oopsla2004.pdf&quot;&gt;wrote the original paper&lt;/a&gt;, which spawned the &amp;lsquo;only mock types you own&amp;rsquo; quote that DHH misappropriates, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;only mock types you own&amp;rdquo; comes from a paper about jMock, which was a port of to Java of &amp;hellip; a Ruby library (and the design style that went along with it).
DHH doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what people were doing in Ruby before he started using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHH&amp;rsquo;s Dependency Injection post is only the most recent crystallization of a slow and insidious change in his approach and language he uses. His posts are filled with deliberately charged and dismissive language like (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3373-getting-hyper-about-hypermedia-apis&quot;&gt;Getting hyper about hypermedia APIs&lt;/a&gt;. This post finishes with DHH equating Hypermedia APIs to WS-*, which suggests he might not understand either beyond a vague surface level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to hypermedia &lt;strong&gt;lore&lt;/strong&gt;, you will be able to &lt;strong&gt;willy nilly&lt;/strong&gt; change your URLs without needing to update any clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3372-put-chubby-models-on-a-diet-with-concerns&quot;&gt;Put chubby models on a diet with concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have the run-time mixin &lt;strong&gt;acrobatics&lt;/strong&gt; nor does it have the &lt;strong&gt;“thy models shall be completely devoid of logic themselves” prescription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3341-pattern-vision&quot;&gt;Pattern Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go deep enough and the pattern vision turns into &lt;strong&gt;articles of faith&lt;/strong&gt;. [&amp;hellip;] &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning patterns into articles of faith takes them out of the realm of rational discussion. Code either adheres to the holy patterns or it doesn’t. If it does not, the programmer must first repent, say his 25 rose-delegations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a writer, he&amp;rsquo;s trying to position himself as seemingly a rational and sane voice illustrating a demon filled world of superstition to a dumb and sheep like congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His position seems more a stance of &lt;strong&gt;anti-intellectualism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people suggest alternate ways of building Rails apps, only for DHH to dismiss it, and then when challenged make his rallying cry of &amp;lsquo;Look at the code! Look at the before and after!&amp;rsquo; and then fail to produce any counterexample himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHH also wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3375-the-five-programming-books-that-meant-most-to-me&quot;&gt;The five programming books that meant the most to me&lt;/a&gt;, a list of which coincidentally the most recent book is from 2003. This list is startlingly missing any of the important recent thinking on Software Design, most excellently lead by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1357920398&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising since DHH is against keeping books he&amp;rsquo;s read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s funny to see people who proclaim a love of &quot;less stuff&quot; still linger on to keeping a wall of paper books. Screw that.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/240550580899155968&quot; data-datetime=&quot;2012-08-28T20:45:02+00:00&quot;&gt;August 28, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There were other tweets he made around that one, where he makes further statements about getting rid of books you&amp;rsquo;ve read, but it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to find them using Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a shame, if only because the re-reading of great books is like having conversations with the great minds of the past. You learn something every time you re-read them, or at least you could if you didn&amp;rsquo;t trash them after reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say that DHH is becoming more and more out of touch with the realities that people face building software systems in the 21st century, or applications that aren&amp;rsquo;t Basecamp, but there is evidence to support that he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be said, that he&amp;rsquo;s so busy attacking any attempts to modernize software development using Rails as &amp;lsquo;dogma&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;the resurgence of Java pattern vision&amp;rsquo;, that he&amp;rsquo;s lacking the ability to introspect on himself, and ask himself the questions about his own cherished beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all is said and done, I still respect David greatly, and we are haircut brethren since time began, I just wish he&amp;rsquo;d stop the attacks, stop being dismissive and read some new books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discuss, upvote, or do whatever the hell you want on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5043573&quot;&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You are your best client (or how to evaluate a startup you think you want to join)</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/you-are-your-best-client-or-how-to-evaluate-a-startup-you-want-to-join-"/>
   <updated>2013-01-03T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/you-are-your-best-client-or-how-to-evaluate-a-startup-you-want-to-join-</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was watching AppSumo chief &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/noahkagan&quot;&gt;Noah Kagan&lt;/a&gt; giving a talk about how to give your customers &lt;em&gt;Lovegasms&lt;/em&gt;. You can watch it here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/GQhzKbjkBr4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One piece of advice he gave is &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;You are your best customer.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the lean customer development process to go out, find and speak to people who have real problems, but we also know that it&amp;rsquo;s great to build something that scratches your own itch, and with that be you own customer. It short circuits the whole process of having to find and validate your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also a good metric for evaluating a startup you think you might want to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the CEO doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent the target customer, if he or she is not even in the same world as the target customer, you and everyone else there are going to have a bad time. Even if the company is some new consumer play, where the behaviors involved in the product are not exactly already widespread, I&amp;rsquo;d still want to see the CEO leading the charge by example and use of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single and most important function of a startup CEO is to have the clear, universal vision about why everyone is there and how they are going to change their customer&amp;rsquo;s worlds, and to clear the path for everyone else in the company to follow them. And it has to be authentic. Which means they have to be the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Fried at 37Signals did it with Basecamp. Tom Preston-Werner did it at Github with Github. Drew Houston did it at Dropbox with Dropbox. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you&amp;rsquo;re looking at some new hot startup that you think you&amp;rsquo;d like to join, check out the CEO. Do they meet the above criteria? Are they authentic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t follow false gods into battle.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What a Dead Man Named FM-2030 can tell us about the future of user names</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/what-a-dead-man-named-fm-2030-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-user-names"/>
   <updated>2013-01-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/what-a-dead-man-named-fm-2030-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-user-names</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/FM2030.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Fereidoun M. Esfandiary&quot; alt=&quot;Fereidoun M. Esfandiary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fereidoun M. Esfandiary was born in Brussels in 1930, and died in New York in 2000 of pancreatic cancer, subsequently being one of the first people cryonically frozen at the Alcor storage facility.  He lived an extremely varied life by most people&amp;rsquo;s standards. Esfandiary had resided in upwards of 17 countries by the time he was 11, traveling with his father who was an Iranian diplomat. He represented Iran as a basketball player in the 1948 Olympics, and later served on the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esfandiary literally wrote the book on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism&quot;&gt;Transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Are-You-Transhuman-Monitoring-Stimulating/dp/0446388068/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1357137985&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Are You a Transhuman?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while teaching at The New School in New York. As a Futurologist, he predicted the invention of Globalization, in-vitro fertilization, teleconferencing, telemedicine and teleshopping amongst other things. He was noted as once saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am a 21st century person who was accidentally launched in the 20th. I have a deep nostalgia for the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how he felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I find the most interesting thing about him is his legal name change in the mid 1970s from &lt;em&gt;Fereidoun M. Esfandiary&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;FM-2030&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did this in a time before people changed their legal names for advertising stunts, to something that looks essentially like a Reddit username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His reasoning was that he felt that Human naming conventions were a relic from its tribalistic past that stamped a person with a pre-determined identity that would degenerate into &amp;lsquo;stereotyping, factionalism and discrimination&amp;rsquo;. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Conventional names define a person&amp;rsquo;s past: ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, religion. I am not who I was ten years ago and certainly not who I will be in twenty years. [&amp;hellip;] The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time. In 2030 we will be ageless and everyone will have an excellent chance to live forever. 2030 is a dream and a goal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think FM-2030&amp;rsquo;s last unheralded prediction for the future was that of wholesale people abandoning their given birth names and taking on the equivalent of a username that is unique to them (and available on all social networks).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his own reasoning for changing his name is sound, he didn&amp;rsquo;t or couldn&amp;rsquo;t have predicted the rise of online social networks where usernames that match existing birth names are becoming a scarce resource even now, and will only continue to grow further scarce in the future. Future generations are going to find it impossible to register themselves on social networks with their actual birth names, because older generations have used them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we come to live in an age where our online accounts and presences become who we are &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; to be, the username becomes the symbol by which others recognize us. Google Plus already tried and failed to make it so that users &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to use their real names. In one of the rare instances where I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M_Stallman&quot;&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt;, he asserted that when Users are forced to give their real names they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=ymuqUJ3MsEs#!&quot;&gt;being mistreated&lt;/a&gt; because it could put those users in danger. This is true, but it will be a secondary force to the growing scarcity of available usernames that match birth names, and a growing population of young adults who are part of online communities or networks from a very young age, and never know anything else. The failure of Google Plus to force users to use their legal birth names is an inevitable outcome of FM-2030&amp;rsquo;s example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this potential future mean for programmers? We have to work with the understanding that there&amp;rsquo;s a possibility in our lifetimes that users will &lt;em&gt;not have first or last names&lt;/em&gt;, for example. They may legally only have one name. How would you process a credit card payment for someone who has only one name if fraud prevention requires it at your payment gateway? And maybe that name happens to be legally, &lt;em&gt;their email address&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe their legal name is (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you ready to be a Transhumanist supporting programmer?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can read more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-2030&quot;&gt;FM-2030 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Future of Social Networks</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/The-Future-of-Social-Networks"/>
   <updated>2013-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/The-Future-of-Social-Networks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are surrounded by noise. The environment around us is noisy; the streets, the airwaves, the oceans. The Universe has a constant background hiss that fills the void between the stars, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_background_radiation&quot;&gt;Cosmic Background Radiation&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, there&amp;rsquo;s the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy&quot;&gt;Entropy&lt;/a&gt;, which says that all organized systems eventually degrade into complete, unorganized chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the future of all Social Networks at present: degenerating into a chaotic morass of meaningless information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;amp;tdim=true&amp;amp;dl=en&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=current%20world%20population&quot;&gt;seven billion people&lt;/a&gt; on this planet, and if all or most of them are to be connected to each other in some degree, then the huge challenge that faces the ongoing existence and usefulness of any social network is how to increase the Signal to Noise ratio present in a user&amp;rsquo;s activity stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What information would a social network need in order to know what updates are most relevant to show you at a particular time, from all of the many &amp;lsquo;friends&amp;rsquo; that you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the answer to this question will eventually be: &amp;lsquo;Everything&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook have already made some inroads into gathering this information by tracking every page you visit with a &amp;lsquo;Like&amp;rsquo; button installed on it, or other nefarious means. Google know a fair amount about your activities on the web, what you search for, what you like, web sites you visit by using their public DNS service and so on. Twitter are gathering you activities from pages you visit with &amp;lsquo;Tweet&amp;rsquo; buttons on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more that a social network knows about your activities, needs and desires, the better it is able to show you things that are relevant to your interests at that time. As more and more people are connected with each other, the amount of information about you that the social network will need to know must increase in order to maintain the Signal to Noise level in the meaningful range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can imagine the huge resources required to undertake this deep level of inspection into a user&amp;rsquo;s activities on the web, resource requirements that as time goes by will only increase. Very few companies are positioned to be able to play at the table of user monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what might the future of Social Networks look like? I&amp;rsquo;m prepared to make some bold predictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will only be one viable social network - probably Facebook. They will acquire every smaller rival in order to add to the information totality they need to know in order to show you &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;s relevant&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter will fail and become a minor player, if not disappear completely, as users come to realize that no viable or meaningful communication can happen there, and as pictures and video become increasingly used as communication. Today, Facebook already probably has all of your pictures, and your picture updates courtesy of the Instagram acquisition. The future will not be constrained to 140 characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySpace is, and will continue to be irrelevant as a meaningful social network, despite their visually appealing &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.myspace.com/play&quot;&gt;smoke and mirrors video&lt;/a&gt;. SoundCloud is where the music crowd are at now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Plus will continue as a minor player until Google acquires or are acquired by Facebook. Google has created a company staffed with people who are no doubt very smart, but have no idea what real users want or need, or how to give it to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foursquare will be acquired by Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path will disappear, having never made it outside of San Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook are experimenting with charging to have posts reach certain users - this is not a viable business model, especially if you believe that knowing everything about a user in real time in order to show them the most relevant thing will become a necessity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will surrender every last shred of privacy as they are sold on the idea that total exposure to their social network of choice in order to have a more relevant and refined experience is the only available course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain updates will become mandatory, probably location and time, in order to know what&amp;rsquo;s around you at a particular time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple may possibly acquire Facebook in order to become the ultimate eCommerce platform that knows exactly what you want, before you know you want it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sounds fun, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Information Diet</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/an-information-diet"/>
   <updated>2012-11-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/an-information-diet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last three weeks I have been following a particular Information Diet program. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deleted Foursquare from my iPhone. It&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;useless&lt;/em&gt; habit that actually encourages anti-social, neurotic behaviours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mail.app is only allowed to run for two or three hours a day as and when needed or appropriate. &lt;em&gt;It is not running in the background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twitter is only allowed for burst of 5-10minutes only at the beginning, middle or end of the day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Un-followed over half of the people I was following on Twitter using this initial guide:&lt;em&gt; From only the persons avatar and description, do I know who they are and why I am following them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary un-following of anyone on Twitter who acts as a repeated for the HackerNews echo chamber, or repeaters of those who do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m using my New York Times subscription as my news source, not Twitter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three weeks that I&#39;ve been following this approach, I&#39;ve found that my concentration and attention span has improved and I feel less anxious. So far, so QED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the other benefits is that I feel less &lt;em&gt;angry. &lt;/em&gt;The effect of having a channel of&amp;nbsp;external&amp;nbsp;anger, outrage or damaged ego du-jour being&amp;nbsp;unfurled&amp;nbsp;before you every time you log on (Twitter &amp;lt;_&amp;lt;) on you own emotional makeup cannot be underestimated. Use Twitter less, and you&#39;ll stop taking on other people&#39;s emotional emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to continue to add to this regimen and tweak it as I face 2013 determined to &lt;em&gt;create more&lt;/em&gt; and consume&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;less.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>McDowall's Conjecture on Remote Working</title>

   <updated>2012-11-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/mcdowalls-conjecture-on-remote-working</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard these excuses time and time again against remote working or working from home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remote teams don&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Working from home leads to decreases in quality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think that collaboration is easier when done face to face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what people are doing if they aren&amp;rsquo;t here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;People just goof off if they work from home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;David Heinemier Hansson, parter at 37Signals, &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3336-cities-with-signals&quot; data-link-type=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Just posted an article&lt;/a&gt; on the number of different places that people have worked from in their time with the company. Github are also known to have an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; geo-distributed team. There are others who manage very well with distributed teams, working remotely. I think it&amp;rsquo;s no coincidence that the common thread amongst these successful geo-distributed companies are that their leaders believe it can work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times that &lt;em&gt;culture is not imposed, it is made up of all of the individuals of a company; their beliefs and standards&lt;/em&gt;. So it is through long observation that I have come to the following rule of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If remote working doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at your company, it&amp;rsquo;s your fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corollary to this rule of thumb is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The management and leadership elements in a company will reflect their own personal biases and previous failures at remote working onto the notion of remote working; they may also fear the power of a truly self-organizing, self-directed team on their own relevance, and will construct the necessary social cues or fear based mechanisms within the company to ensure its failure or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Twitter Must Go</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/twitter-must-go"/>
   <updated>2012-11-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/twitter-must-go</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somehow, it has become part of my morning ritual that upon waking I immediately check Twitter on my iPhone 4. I think that it eases me into the day by getting my brain going, quickly checking for news headlines, or interesting Tweets with links.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that it actually rarely leads to finding anything satisfying, and often sucks me in to 15 to 20 minutes of aimless browsing sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve began to question the usefulness of Twitter in my life and why I feel so attached to a medium that is broken. I gave up paying attention to the distorting mainstream media several years ago, but it could be time for a swing back to something of a certain level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to replace Twitter in the morning with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp5558.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;m going to limit Twitter use to one session per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I&#39;m just going to stop using it for consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to make their own decision, obviously, but Twitter has reached its peak of maximum onanism for me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vagrant: Run commands from Rake as the vagrant user</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/vagrant-running-commands-from-rake-as-the-vagrant-user"/>
   <updated>2012-10-30T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/vagrant-running-commands-from-rake-as-the-vagrant-user</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was trying to find out a way of running some commands inside the Vagrant virtual machine as the &lt;em&gt;vagrant&lt;/em&gt; user, not as &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt;, which is what the &lt;em&gt;channel.sudo()&lt;/em&gt; method does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a while of trying to find some documentation on the official Vagrant site, and finding none, I eventually found a call in the Vagrant source code for &lt;em&gt;channel.execute()&lt;/em&gt; - which does run the passed commands as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;vagrant&lt;/em&gt; user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job done, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not really. I did what all good citizens of the open source community should do, which was to fork the Vagrant documentation repo, update the documentation, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/pull/1214&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submit a pull request&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &#39;Boy Scout&#39; principal prevails - try to leave the campsite tidier than when you found it. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Apple Television is already here</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/the-apple-television-is-already-here"/>
   <updated>2012-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/the-apple-television-is-already-here</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Edgar Allen Poe wrote a fairly entertaining story back in December 1844 called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purloined_Letter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;In the story, a stolen letter is sought after by the Police and they search a room belonging to the suspect for the letter, looking behind every picture frame, underneath every object. The thief, knowing that the Police would be searching for something hidden, left the letter in plain sight&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;he knew they would be blind to it in their search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at Apple&#39;s recent product update event, we saw two things of particular interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is that they brought forward the typical iPad refresh forward from the Spring when it has historically happened, into the Fall. On the historical Apple event calendar this now creates a gap in the release cycle next year, as according to previous events, the next typical Apple product update is OSX in the summer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second item of interest is that the iMac received a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ca/imac/features/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very dramatic update&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.squarespace.com/static/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4716/4ff4f78ac4aaf05888ec4725/508a9790e4b08eaef9f325ab/1351260050133/processors_hero.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The iMac has been made ultra-thin; apparently by as much as 80% thinner. It&#39;s a beautiful piece of engineering and design; something worthy of hanging on a wall perhaps? While that is a dramatic engineering feat of its own right, the secondary thing of interest to note is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MC914LL/B/apple-thunderbolt-display-27-inch?fnode=53&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thunderbolt display&lt;/a&gt; which would seem to share much of the component and chassis characteristics of the iMac&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;did not receive an update.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbolt display, essentially a fancy monitor, could be redundant in a post Apple Television world. It happens to already be the most TV-like device Apple makes. Choosing not to update it, then, would make sense - if you intended to do something dramatic in the Spring, something dramatic that you just happened to have created room for by bringing the iPad refresh forward in the update cycle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the new iMac chassis could well be a pre-cursor to the design and shape of an Apple Television, which will be released in the Spring of 2013. I believe it contains, at the very least, the DNA of this new Apple endeavour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if Apple have hidden their next direction in plain sight. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Best Hardware is not a Job Perk</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/the-best-hardware-is-not-a-job-perk"/>
   <updated>2012-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/the-best-hardware-is-not-a-job-perk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s very common for startups to advertise that they provide you with the &#39;best&#39; hardware, usually Apple, as a perk of the job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could very likely be a warning sign, in my experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that someone would sell you a job opportunity, with the notion that they are not going to give you a stone age behemoth, a 640x480 resolution screen, reclaimed high school chairs and a desk made from breeze blocks and planks, and that anything above that is a &#39;perk&#39; is insanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also likely means that your hire is viewed as a cog that needs to be fitted into the machine, and the necessary equipment you need is seen as a condition that grudgingly must be supplied in order to attract talent. They view the tools that you use as simply a ploy to get you inside, and don&#39;t value the difference they make to your working life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am telling you that this is your &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. You are expected to work 8-12hr or longer days, remain seated or stationary staring at a device that causes your eyes to dry out and any myriad of other health problems; the &#39;best&#39; is the absolute minimum required. A fast, efficient machine to work on is not a joyful toy given to pacify - it is a means to professional excellence. It is a means to creative flow. It is a means to doing the best work of your life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&#39;s talk about the &#39;best&#39;. Usually its assumed that you will want everything Apple, and maybe this is the case.&amp;nbsp;Maybe you don&#39;t want two screens, because one large one works for you. Maybe you just really like Dell machines.&amp;nbsp;But a good employer will understand that Humans taken different things to help them achieve good and sustainable work, so closing that dialog off early could also be a warning sign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on the specifications for the &#39;best&#39;, it should stand to reason that the equipment should be the top of the line possible. If the machine you want can take 16Gb of RAM, then it should be ordered with 16Gb of RAM in it. An 512Gb SSD should be the default. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employers will take a wait and see approach to developers complaining that they need more resources, and this is very sad. They are shortchanging themselves, and they are devaluing you and the work that you do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes this is expensive. But if the company you want to work for values you as a Human, and that you spend a far greater amount of time on the tools you need to do your work than you should, and if they understand that the better the hardware you have to work on can make you more efficient and &lt;i&gt;happier &amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;and more able to do great work, then they are likely to view it as a cost that simply has to be met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s a company you want to work for. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Henry Miller Was a Better Programmer Than You Are</title>

   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/henry-miller-was-a-better-programmer-than-you-are</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Miller&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Henry Miller&lt;/a&gt; was an American writer and painter, famous for pushing the boundaries of literature and creating several seminal and controversial works. In his book &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Henry-Miller-Writing-Directions-Paperbook/dp/0811201120&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Henry Miller on Writing&lt;/a&gt;&#39; he speaks about his &#39;Commandments&#39; and &#39;Daily Program&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henry Miller&#39;s 11 Commandments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on one thing at a time until finished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start no more new books, add no more new material to ‘Black Spring.’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you can’t create you can work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henry Miller&#39;s Daily Program:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORNINGS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If groggy, type notes and allocate, as stimulus.If in fine fettle, write.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERNOONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work of section in hand, following plan of section scrupulously. No intrusions, no diversions. Write to finish one section at a time, for good and all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVENINGS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;See friends. Read in cafés.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore unfamiliar sections — on foot if wet, on bicycle if dry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write, if in mood, but only on Minor program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paint if empty or tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Notes. Make Charts, Plans. Make corrections of MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: Allow sufficient time during daylight to make an occasional visit to museums or an occasional sketch or an occasional bike ride. Sketch in cafés and trains and streets. Cut the movies! Library for references once a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Great writers and thinkers are often found to have had such &#39;programs&#39; and commandments that helped give structure to the work that they did. Given that I am now operating my own software consultancy and product development studio, a regimen like this could be beneficial since the life of a writer and a programmer share certain parallels in the type of structured creativity that must be applied. I think that Miller&#39;s ability to do great work is somewhat related to his ability to maintain an ordered structure to his day and to his work. He shipped. Relentlessly. And this probably makes him a better programmer than you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s my first interpretation of Miller&#39;s commandments and program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My 11 Commandments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on one thing at a time until finished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with no more new frameworks or libraries until the current work is done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with a good test suite, and keep a clear and consistent dialog with your clients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you can’t create you can work. Fix bugs or perform code gardening and weeding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers. Invest time in your tools and get better at them -don&#39;t supriously add new ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it. Twitter is not a substitiute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forget the programs you want to write. Think only of the program you are writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code first and always.

   <title>A Prediction: What GitHub Will Do Next With That $100M</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/a-prediction-what-github-will-do-next-with-that-100m"/>
   <updated>2012-07-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/a-prediction-what-github-will-do-next-with-that-100m</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As everyone is no doubt aware, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1189-investing-in-github&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub took on $100M&lt;/a&gt; of investment capital from Andreessen-Horowitz recently. The big question on everybody&#39;s lips was: &#39;Why?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s look at the clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen wrote recently about &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html&quot;&gt;Why Software is Eating The World&lt;/a&gt;&#39;. It&#39;s a great article and if you haven&#39;t read it I&#39;ll wait for you to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Andreessen highlights a number of areas where software has converged to make two previously separate things work together in new ways that allow the makers to gobble up markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we think about GitHub, and a $100M injection of capital, what&#39;s the missing piece that could allow GitHub to expand and gobble up a new market place? Who should be afraid of this turn of events?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub is where increasingly more of the world&#39;s code &lt;em&gt;lives.&lt;font class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=&quot;#111111&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;font class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=&quot;#111111&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;The code is created by developers, distributed through GitHub and deployed onto servers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2, Heroku and Windows Azure are increasingly the end destination for much of that code. You can deploy to Heroku with a simple commit and push via Git. It&#39;s a lucrative market, with Salesforce recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/&quot;&gt;snapping up Heroku for $212M in cash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that the next phase of GitHub will be to build its own Platform as a Service&lt;/strong&gt;, that will provide exactly the same benefits and services as Heroku, but at a radical price point. GitHub will use that $100M of capital to build out this service and developers will flock to it, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because their code already lives on GitHub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; They will build an frictionless experience that trumps any existing deploy model, perhaps even so that your code just automatically becomes available on the web after each commit. Closing the deploy loop is the next logical step for GitHub, and a reason why they would need cash in excess of their current profits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub will become&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; de-facto development platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then GitHub will eat the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Working for a Software Company in the 21st Century Should Be Like</title>

   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/what-working-for-a-software-company-in-the-21st-century-should-be-like</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s my manifesto of sorts on what the modern working environment for information workers should be like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on results shipped not time spent. &lt;/strong&gt;It shouldn&#39;t matter how little or how much time is &#39;put in&#39; on a given day because you know and trust that all of your co-workers are investing just as much into the business as you are, and that people have been hired to do the right thing. Let them. And let them do it in the way that is optimal for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location independent. &lt;/strong&gt;There is no need for teams to be co-located today. It&#39;s often said that remote teams just don&#39;t work, but I think this is a combination of two things: hiring the wrong people, and a failure in shared understanding and purpose. Both of these things are management issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free flowing. &lt;/strong&gt;Work should be able to be started with the minimum amount of process as possible, and should be allowed to proceed until complete.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Focussed. &lt;/strong&gt;The customer is most definitely not always right, especially on the Internet, but everyone in the company needs to understand that we are here to provide value for the customer, not to pad our Resumes or architect systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptable. &lt;/strong&gt;If anyone needs to take time off, this should be achievable with the minimum amount of fuss and red-tape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsible Vacations.&lt;/strong&gt; People should be allowed to plan and take time off whenever it is needed. And when they come back they should be expected to knock it out of the park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting-less. &lt;/strong&gt;A zero meeting environment may be impossible, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Meetings_Are_Toxic.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they are toxic&lt;/a&gt; and should be avoided at all costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metric based. &lt;/strong&gt;What cannot be measured cannot be managed. No one should be judged except on the value of their output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid. &lt;/strong&gt;People should be allowed to move from work area to work area. It&#39;ll increase their skills and make better products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently watched Startup.com, and here&#39;s some notes I jotted down while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should all trust that any one of us will represent a vision of the business that will be seconded and thirded by anyone in the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should never be in a confrontation / debate stage in front of anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a sadness about watching ideas grow until they&#39;re beyond the point where you can do anything for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as someone says &quot;There&#39;s no need for this to be ugly&quot; it&#39;s going to get ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet your competitors, befriend them. Force them into making plays earlier than they want to. But only if your product tangibly is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t make your company about your personality as a CEO who &#39;doesn&#39;t lose&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&#39;t matter if the market is big, it&#39;s a question of who can make money in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always have a third party who can arbitrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a &#39;Days to Live&#39; countdown board with focussed tasks to achieve in that time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone should use the product, CEO down to the person who answers the phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be critical on the status of your product&#39;s functionality. If it doesn&#39;t work, say it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep momentum on Testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security of your product, your office, everything is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be concerned about revenue. Don&#39;t be concerned about the Board. It&#39;s their prerogative to fire you or re*shuffle as they see fit, and they will do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals need to be specific and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any company with two CEOs is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in 2001, mobile phones had some horrific extendable antennas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales cycles are always longer than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things change. That&#39;s the best part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decline happens quickly and noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scariest part of this movie is Kaleil Tuzman driving along a wet highway, chanting to a CD and reading from a book held against the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Old Houses and Software Projects</title>
   <link href="http://zachholman.com/posts/old-houses-and-software-projects"/>
   <updated>2012-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/old-houses-and-software-projects</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Old Houses are products of accretion. Over the course of many years they gather new extensions, tweaked facades, upgraded central or under-floor heating systems, alarm systems, downstairs washrooms and nurseries. And usually, once one project is completed, you&#39;ll bask in the glow of it for a while until it&#39;s forgotten about and the next one embarked upon. Just like Software projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lived once in a big, old house which had stood for over 80 years. It&#39;d been split up so that a couple lived in the back portion, I lived in the front half, and there was a basement apartment. Sound can travel in funny ways in such old houses, split up like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see there are the remenants of what were once ducts for the purposes of a forced air central heating system, all through the house. The air vents are now partially sealed, but the ornamentation on the baseboard that gives away their purpose is still there. The ducts lie embedded within the walls still. Long forgotten about, these heating ducts were probably installed at great expense at the time, for what was felt to be the ultimate in home comfort: hot air blown into the rooms from a central heater!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, the old air heater was pulled out, radiators were found and installed, and a fancy Swedish boiler system now silently and efficiently pumps hot water around the piping and heats the house. And the ducts remain, in the walls, now sealed up and silent. Except for when they carry sound in funny ways. Old houses are like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I was treated to the sounds of someone somewhere else in the house enjoying vigorous, short lived coitus, the echoes of it carried inside the bones of the house, inside these long forgoten about ducts that serve no purpose. Should the ducts be ripped out? That would be very costly, disruptive to the residents, and damaging to the house. So they stay. Silently embedded within the walls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the infastructure portions of almost every software design that&#39;s ever been written. Look at your codebase. Is there something in there, some remnant of infrastructure that was built with the greatest of hopes and expectations, only to be roundly replaced when you understood the problem better? Has it left a legacy that occasionally flares up or acts as the conduit for some other misbehaving component in the project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing that code might be too hard now, because nobody writes perfect software. Some brittle tests somewhere might flare up, or a method call somewhere might explode.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet that code sits there, inside your digital walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Projects can be like building houses. The construction continues long after the thing is &#39;finished&#39;, and you end up living with the choices you make for a long time, usually forever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, in the night, you hear odd noises carried by those old ducts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Management Can Destroy Creativity</title>

   <updated>2012-07-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://zachholman.com/posts/how-management-can-destroy-creativity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking platform developers and throwing them against hard goals and deadlines kills your ability to adapt. Management and project stakeholders end up making too many decisions about the technology away from the people who know it best – the people building it. To show progress and keep management happy, engineers shift their focus to tangible deliverables and ignore the pieces management can’t understand, like the underlying architecture. You start going down the path of building lots of bells and whistles, but nothing solid that you can competitively leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of July 2010, the site received 100 billion hits, held more than 50 billion photos, cached 3 trillion objects, and accumulated 130 TB of logs a day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook is the most complex distributed software system ever created.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Space Shuttle is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/upgrades/upgrades5.html&quot; data-bitly-type=&quot;bitly_hover_card&quot;&gt;most complex machine&lt;/a&gt; ever built.

It cannot fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as the Space Shuttle has been retired, so will Facebook be placed on the funeral boat and shoved out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something better will replace it, just as the Space Shuttle is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/09/say-hello-to-your-new-space-shuttle-replacement.php&quot; data-bitly-type=&quot;bitly_hover_card&quot;&gt;replaced by smaller, leaner craft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will replace Facebook?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
